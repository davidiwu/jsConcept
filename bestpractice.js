// Hoist:
// Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope (to the top of the current script or the current function).
// Variables and constants declared with let or const are not hoisted!

// Scope:
// 
// ECMAScript 2015
// ES2015 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.
// These two keywords provide Block Scope variables (and constants) in JavaScript.
// Before ES2015, JavaScript had only two types of scope: Global Scope and Function Scope.
